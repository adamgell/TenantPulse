# TenantPulse Phase 1 - internal status

This is internal development/task narrative, moved out of README.md (post-review fix -
README.md is meant to read as a PSGallery landing page, not an implementation log). Nothing
here is required to install or use TenantPulse; see README.md for that.

## Phase 1 engine: complete

Collection, evaluation, scoring, and the deterministic pseudonymized JSON report all work
end to end through `Invoke-PulseAssessment`, and the whole pipeline has been
**live-smoke verified against a real tenant** (the Ivy24 lab tenant, Task 1.11): a fresh
`Invoke-PulseAssessment -ProfileId ivy24` run collected real Intune data
(`deviceCompliancePolicies`, `deviceConfigurations`, `deviceManagementSettings`,
`managedDevices`), degraded a permission gap honestly (`conditionalAccessPolicies` Skipped
with reason `permission-denied: Policy.Read.All`, its dependent checks NotApplicable rather
than silently wrong), left every not-yet-released GraphKit descriptor Skipped with
`descriptor-pending`, produced real Pass findings from the data that did collect, and
re-evaluating the same snapshot via `-FromSnapshot` reproduced a byte-identical findings
JSON. The tenant identifier appeared nowhere in the output tree except as its `tp-...`
pseudonym.

The live run also surfaced a real GraphKit 0.1.0 error-shape gap (its `Get-GraphObject`
throw carries no structured status code or `403`/`forbidden` text on failure) that made a
genuine permission denial misclassify as a generic failure instead of the honest-degradation
path above; that gap was fixed in the collector (a supplemental, read-only
`Invoke-GraphOperation` call recovers the real status code) with a regression test pinning
the fix against the real shape.

## Final fix wave (this pass)

A merged fix list from two independent reviews was implemented in full - contract fixes
(pseudonym-input source moved from `-ProfileId` to the resolved tenant id; `-Path`
parameters renamed to explicit `-OutputPath`/`-CatalogPath` with a deprecated alias),
snapshot-store boundary hardening (clear-on-reuse, manifest type validation, atomic
writes extracted into a shared helper), determinism/redaction fixes (a datetime
round-trip byte-drift bug, a culture-sensitive sort reaching document bytes, an
under-redacted evidence field, a DateTime-Kind-Unspecified handling bug in the canonical
serializer), check-logic fixes (a break-glass exemption that could wrongly exempt a
group/role-reachable account, an admin-MFA check that did not count `includeUsers: 'All'`
coverage, a dataset-status gate that enumerated bad statuses instead of failing closed on
any non-`Collected` status, a stale-device check that could silently fall back to
wall-clock time on a malformed manifest timestamp, an auth-abort loop that could overwrite
a Pending dataset's real reason), publish-tooling hardening (a shipped-file digest manifest
recorded at test time and verified at publish time, a `[SecureString]`/environment-variable
-only API key parameter, enum-typed HTTP status code handling, a silent supplemental-recovery
failure upgraded to a visible warning plus an artifact-level marker), and the public-facing
skin (this README, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md, the `about_TenantPulse` help topic, pinned build
tool versions, an extended offline secret scan, and this file).

## GraphKit 0.1.1 migration (Task 1.11, complete)

GraphKit 0.1.1 is published to PSGallery and both pins (`source/TenantPulse.psd1`,
`RequiredModules.psd1`) are bumped. The migration:

- Deleted the `Get-PulseGraphFailureStatusCode` supplemental-probe workaround entirely -
  GraphKit 0.1.1's `Get-GraphObject` now throws an `ErrorRecord` with structured signal
  (`CategoryInfo.Category`, `TargetObject.Telemetry[-1].StatusCode`) directly, so no
  extra read-only Graph call is needed to recover a status code. `Get-PulseFailureClass`
  was rewritten to consume that ErrorRecord's structured data first, falling back to the
  rendered message only when neither signal is present.
- Dropped `Pending = $true` from all six DatasetMap.psd1 entries that had it
  (`securityDefaultsPolicy`, `directoryRoleAssignments`, `directoryRoleDefinitions`,
  `organization`, `organizationMdmAuthority`, `entraDevices`) - the static read-only QA
  gate (`tests/QA/ReadOnly.tests.ps1`) auto-upgraded all six to live catalog verification
  against installed GraphKit 0.1.1 and they pass the real Read/Safe predicate. The
  Pending mechanism itself stays covered by a synthetic fixture for the next descriptor
  that ships Pending.
- `./build.ps1 -Tasks pack` now produces `output/TenantPulse.0.1.0.nupkg` cleanly
  (GraphKit's `ExternalModuleDependencies` fix resolved the prior pack-time blocker).
  `scripts/Publish-TenantPulsePackage.ps1`'s dry run passes end-to-end (digest-manifest
  verification, no key, no publish).

**Two live-gate surprises, both fixed with regression tests** (first real run of the six
newly-live descriptors against a real tenant):

1. Two of the six datasets (`organization`, `directoryRoleAssignments`) carry the raw
   tenant GUID as a genuine Graph response FIELD (`Organization.id`,
   `DirectoryRoleAssignment.principalOrganizationId`), not merely a GraphKit provenance
   stamp. Fixed with a new `Protect-PulseGraphRowTenantId` helper, wired into
   `Write-PulseDataset`, that walks every row's value tree and redacts an exact match of
   the raw tenant id to its pseudonym before the dataset file is written. +5 regression
   tests in `Snapshot.Tests.ps1`.
2. `Protect-PulseGraphRowTenantId`'s first cut walked Hashtable-valued properties (e.g. a
   real `ConditionalAccessPolicy`'s `conditions`/`grantControls`, which GraphKit returns
   as `OrderedHashtable`, not `PSCustomObject`) via `.PSObject.Properties` - which
   surfaces a Hashtable's own adapter members (`Keys`, `Values`, `SyncRoot`, ...) rather
   than its dictionary entries. A non-synchronized Hashtable's `SyncRoot` IS the same
   hashtable, so the walk recursed into itself and blew PowerShell's call depth on every
   policy row (reproduced live: ~4s burned per row before falling back to the unredacted
   original - TOTAL-by-construction meant it never crashed the run, but it silently
   defeated the redaction on any Hashtable-nested tenant id and made collection
   pathologically slow). Fixed by walking `IDictionary` via its own `Keys`/`this[key]`
   entries, checked before the generic PSObject branch. +1 regression test pinning a
   Hashtable-nested tenant GUID redacts correctly and fast (<2s).

**Live gate re-run against Ivy24 after both fixes, clean**: all 11 datasets Collected
(including `securityDefaultsPolicy` - no 403; the tenant's granted `Policy.Read.All`
covers it), all 10 seed checks resolved with real statuses (5 Pass, 3 Fail, 1
NotApplicable, 0 Error), coverage 9/10 (90%), `-FromSnapshot` reproduced a byte-identical
findings JSON, and the raw tenant GUID appears nowhere in the output tree (datasets,
manifest, or findings) - only its `tp-...` pseudonym.

## Not yet done - one thing, an operator action, not code

1. **First publish to PSGallery**, which needs a PSGallery API key. Publish tooling is
   ready (`scripts/Publish-TenantPulsePackage.ps1`) but defaults to a dry run and refuses
   to publish without a resolved API key and `-Confirm`; Adam runs it.
